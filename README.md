## Shade: My personal Discord Bot written in TypeScript, using Discord.js

# Guide
I tried to make this as friendly as posible for everyone. If you're new to this, maybe this can help you.
Check inside of the files that the bot has to get information about what that file does, and how to use it.

# Installation
Clone this repository, and run this command in your terminal, once you're inside of the folder that has the bot: `npm install`, which will automatically install all the dependencies that the bot has.

# secrets.json File
There's a secrets.json file inside of the ./src folder, where you store private information. Here's how it looks like:
```json
{
    "token": "Your bot's token.",
    "developer": "Your own ID.",
    "guild": "The server you're going to register the commands to. Also referred as 'Development Server.'"
}
```
